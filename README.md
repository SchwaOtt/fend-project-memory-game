## Gameplay

Take it in turn to pick two cards. If the cards have the same figur (two cube, for example), the cards keep face-up position and are out of the game. If not, the cards are returned to their face-down position and the game continues. Play until all the cards have been matched.

## Challenge

Try to pair with the fewest possible steps in the minimum time.
